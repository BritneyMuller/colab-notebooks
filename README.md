# Colab-Notebooks
_Explore a new Machine Learning Playground of opportunity!_ 

## Remember:
* You can't break anything in a Colab Notebook! 
* If you can click Shift + Return, you can explore these notebooks (and endless others!)
* Connect to Colab's free GPU (Edit > Notebook Settings > Hardware accelerator > GPU)

## Bonus Noob Colab Tips:
* You can only have 2 Notebooks running at one time. 
* If a Notebook is giving you errors (when it was previously working) try: Runtime > Restart Runtime
* You can upload private keys.json in the left side bar > Click bottom file > Upload <--You can copy the filepath once uploaded to ensure you are pulling your keys correctly.
* If you call for a csv export ```db.to_csv('sample1.csv')``` you can download it within the left sidebar document area.
* Learn basic Jupyter/Colab commands to manipulate dataframes (your future self will thank you!): bit.ly/learn-df <--Shout out to Robin Lord!
